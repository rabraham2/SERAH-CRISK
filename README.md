# SERAH-CRISK
CRISK is an end-to-end credit risk pipeline on the UCI Taiwan Credit Card dataset. It cleans and prepares data, trains a leak-safe model to predict the probability of default (PD), calibrates and evaluates performance, and then converts scores into Approve/Review/Decline decisions and credit limits under explicit portfolio loss constraints.
